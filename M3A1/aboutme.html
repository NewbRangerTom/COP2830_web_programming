                <h2 id="ACADEMIC">Academic History and Goals:</h2>
                <p>I started taking college courses in the mid 1990's. I was in the Army and wanted to gain points for promotion. I didn't start working towards a degree until after
					 I had retired in 2012. I started an Associates Degree program at <a href="http://www.cochise.edu/" target="_blank">Cochise College</a>. I took classes part time while I worked
					  in a full time position for the DOD. I moved to Florida in 2014 and put my degree on hold until 2019. I officially transfered to <a href="https://www.irsc.edu" target="_blank">IRSC</a>
					 in the fall of 2019. I started full time in the spring of 2020 and completed the Associates Degree Program in Computer Information Technology the fall of 2021. 
					 Starting the Bachelor's program was a last minute decision, but I started Bachelor's level coures the spring of 2022. I am attending classes part-time as my schedule allows.</p>
            
                <h2 id="PERSONAL">My Personal Interests:</h2>
                <p>My interest in computer technology began back in the mid 80's. Both of my parents worked for the telephone company and brough home our first computer in 1986.
                This computer had an 8086 processor, two 5.25 inch floppy drives, 128MBs of RAM, and no modem. While I was in high school I added a 2400 baud (2400 bit/s) modem and
                upgraded the graphics to VGA. I also learned a little bit of unix programming. When I enlisted in the Army I wanted to work with computers but wound up working with
                radio systems providing long range data transmission for the telephone and eventually computer/netowrk technicians.
                </p>
                <p>My interests are varied and many. I enjoy cycling, cinema, music, vinyl albums, technology, reading non-fiction and
                    sci-fi, road trips, ancestry, and family. </p>
