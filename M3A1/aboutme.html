                <h3 id="ACADEMIC">Academic History and Goals:</h3>
                <p> <span class="tab">I</span> started attending college in 1989. I enrolled at the <a href="https://www.arizona.edu" target="_blank">University of Arizona (UofA)</a>. I wanted to take an 
					extra elective course in high school but had graduation requirements that needed to be met.<br>
					<span class="tab">After</span> high school I took college courses to get points for promotion to Sergeant in the Army. At that point I did not have a plan 
					and had not declared any majors. During the mid 1990's, I took courses at <a href="https://www.ctcd.edu/" target="_blank">Central Texas College</a> I thought 
					would help me with my military duties.<br>
					<span class="tab">In</span> 2012 I retired from the Army and decided to go back to school to obtain an Associate's degree. I enrolled at 
					<a href="http://www.cochise.edu/" target="_blank">Cochise College</a> in Sierra Vista, Arizona. I enrolled in the Computer Information Technology Associate's 
					Degree Program as a full time student. Two months after starting my first semester I was offered a DOD contract possition I could not turn down. I dropped my 
					coures rate to part time.<br>
					<span class="tab">In</span> 2014 my wife was offered a possition that she could not turn down so we moved to Florida. I was not able to finish the Associate's 
					program before moving so I put it on hold for a few years and focused on finding a new carreer for myself and being more present for my youngest child while she 
					was in high school. at the end of 2019 I decided it was time to finish the Associate's degee I had started and transfered to 
					<a href="https://www.irsc.edu" target="_blank">IRSC</a>. I started as a full time student in the spring of 2020 only to have the world shut down by COVID-19. I 
					worked within the COVID restirctions and mandates finishing the Associate's program the fall of 2021. I also completed the requirements for the Help Desk Support 
					Technician, Computer Information Data Specialist, and Information Technology Support certificate programs. I started the IRSC Information Technology Management 
					and Cyber Security Bachelor's program in January 2022. I am currently taking courses part time for the Bachelor's program.

                <h3 id="PERSONAL">My Personal Interests:</h3>
                <p><span class="tab">My</span> interests are varied and many. I enjoy cinema, music, vinyl albums, technology, reading non-fiction and sci-fi, road trips, ancestry, and family.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="tab">My</span> interest in computer technology began back in the mid 80's. Both of my parents worked for the telephone company and brough home our 
					first computer in 1986. This computer had an 8086 processor, two 5.25 inch floppy drives, 128MBs of RAM, and no modem. While I was in high school I added a 2400 
					baud (2400 bit/s) modem and upgraded the graphics to VGA. I also learned a little bit of unix programming. When I enlisted in the Army I wanted to work with 
					computers but wound up working with radio systems providing long range data transmission for the telephone and eventually computer/netowrk technicians.<br>
					<span class="tab">My</span> love of the cinema goes back to my childhood. My dad started taking me to the movies as soon as I could get through one. I have loved 
					the sound, lights, the curtins, and the smells of the cinema since then.<br>
					<span class="tab">For</span> audiophiles, the 80s and 90s were amazing years. Hip-hop and Grunge were born, Hair-bands had hair higher than a 50's Beehive, the 
					popularity of heavy-metal wasn't just in the form of an animated movie, and the 90's are touted as one of the greatest decades for the country genre. The walkman 
					was new and meant you could listen to what you liked anywhere you wanted to go as long as you had spare batteries. Vinyl started fading out of mainstream as the 
					CD player came on the market. Movies incorporated the soundtrack into the story to help tell the stories. I like to many artists and styles of music to have a 
					favorite. Music can make your mood or augment your mood.<br>
					<span class="tab">One</span> of the first books I read for leisure was J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit". I have been fascinated with fantasy and science fiction 
					(sci-fi) since. Elves, Mages, Warriors, and Monsters provide me with an escape from everything I do not like. I was so immersed in J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" 
					series that I had the hardest time putting the books down.<br>
					<span class="tab">I</span> have loved muscle cars since I was a teen. I first fell in love with road-trips in the mid 1990's when I drove to Anchorage, Alaska 
					in a 1972 Plymouth Duster. I find being on the road, seeing new places, and traveling to visit family has a lot more meaning to me. Maybe it's the freedom of 
					being able to go where you want when you want after so many years in the Army working in tight spaces and usually to not such pretty places.
