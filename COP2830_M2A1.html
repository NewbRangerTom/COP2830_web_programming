                <h2>Career Interests</h2>
                <p>I am interested in networks, data analytics, embedded systems, and programming (software developement for embedded systems).
                I want to do something that keeps my mind busy and interested. </p>
                
                <h2>Personal Background</h2>
                <p>I am originally from Tucson, Arizona. I graduated high school in 1991. I was 46 years old when I found out I have an older sister and a few months later found out my closest cousins have a half sister also.</p>
                <p>	
                    I enlisted in the Army after graduating high school. I was a multichannel
                    communications specialist and operated microwave radio systems most of my career. I retied from the Army in 2012 after
                    20 years of service. I been stationed in Alaska, Arizona, South Korea (x2), and Texas (x3). I deployed to Iraq from 2005-2006.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have been married three times and have three adult children.
                </p>
                
                <h2>My Programming Interests</h2>
                <p>My interest in computer technology began back in the mid 80's. Both of my parents worked for the telephone company and brough home our first computer in 1986.
                   This computer had an 8086 processor, two 5.25 inch floppy drives, 128MBs of RAM, and no modem. While I was in high school I added a 2400 baud (2400 bit/s) modem and
                   upgraded the graphics to VGA. I also learned a little bit of unix programming. When I enlisted in the Army I wanted to work with computers but wound up working with
                   radio systems providing long range data transmission for the telephone and eventually computer/netowrk technicians.
                </p>
                <p>My interests are varied and many. I enjoy cycling, cinema, music, vinyl albums, technology, reading non-fiction and
                    sci-fi, road trips, ancestry, and family. </p>
